# snake
a very crude snake game using cpp. ( just for pactice :p )
actually you can lose in this game because you wont lose when the snake hit the wall. rather it will "eat" through the wall.
(just for fun :p)

theoretically working both on Linux and Windows.
running in terminal. using ANSI control code, so make sure your terminal support it. on Windows, powershell is suggested.
